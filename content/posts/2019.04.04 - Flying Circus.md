Flying Circus is a framework for the simulation and analysis of aerodynamic loads in flexible aircraft developed in the Python programming language. It's development started during my master of engineering studies.

The name comes from the amazing _Monty Python's Flying Circus_ the TV program that also inspired the name of the Python language itself.

The code is not currently user friendly, lots of functions are poorly commented, some are not commented at all, but I decided to start sharring it anyway. In the future I intend to correct this problems.

You can find the projects official site [here][1] and it's github page [here][2].
